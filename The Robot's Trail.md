## The Robot's Trail  
You enter a virtual maze, a labyrinth of shifting corridors and endless paths. A guardian robot patrols  
the floor, leaving a trail behind as it moves. Follow the path it carves, trace its movements  
carefully, and uncover the key it leads you to. Only by following the robotâ€™s trail can you reach the  
door to the next floor.

Seeing the challenge, I immediately knew it was a traversal challenge.  
By first inspecting the page(`<div class="hidden">
        <p>Start by checking what this site tells search engine bots in <a href="/robots.txt" style="color: #00bcd4;">robots.txt</a></p>`) and then just following the clues, I got the flag.
