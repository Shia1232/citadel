## Rotten Apple 
Among the debris of this floor, you find a relic of sound: An album which turns out to be  
D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L by Panchiko, a long lost album. But the music is warped, as though it has undergone  
disc rot.  


The path forward is hidden in the distortion. Similar to how the album was warped, the password to the  
next floor has been warped first by a factor of 47, then by a factor of 13. Untangle these changes to  
reveal the code and continue your ascent.

### Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{b3tt3r_ROTt3n}`
I used ROT-13 first and then ROT-47 to get the flag.
