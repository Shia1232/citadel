## Rotting In The Deep
The floor is quiet, almost unnervingly so â€“ like the Citadel has paused to take your measure. A soft  
ring of presence settles around the chamber, the kind that marks a true landing: from here, it will ask  
for more and, in return, grant more. Etched into its surface is a sequence of numbers, worn and faint,  
as if time itself is eating them away. A whisper from the echoes guides you:  

The message lies beneath the surface. Push it three steps forward in the cycle of life, and only then  
will the words emerge from the void.  
### Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{br0_r34lly_unr0tt3d_m3_b4ck_t0_l1f3}`
By seeing the python script, I understood we have to use +3 and use something to get 6895840967002953721051398351211751734500850509315790892845302801984496338433523326225010635779036738800318 as the  
output. Thus by applying a shift of -3 and then converting the long into bytes, we got the flag.
