## The Ripper 
The guardian of this floor steps from the shadows. Known only as Jack the Ripper, he watches you  
carefully. He proclaims himself merciful and hands you a word list to help. He asks you to find the  
passcode hidden in the file. The word list is your only aid. Only by combining the two correctly, can  
you uncover the key and move on to the next floor.   


Flag format: citadel{password}  
### Solve  
**Flag:**  `citadel{fake_flag_4_fake_pl4y3rs}`
I put the hash into an online tool to uncover the possible hashing protocols it could follow.  
I tried bcrypt and got the flag using the password fake_flag_4_fake_pl4y3rs.
